**What is Mechanical Recycling?**

**Mechanical recycling of plastics** involves processes like collecting, sorting, washing, shredding, melting, and regranulating plastic waste into new, usable raw materials. This method retains the original polymer structure, making it ideal for recycling plastics such as polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polypropylene (PP), and others.

**Key Market Drivers**

1. **Stringent Global Regulations**\
   Countries across Europe, North America, and parts of Asia have implemented strict regulations targeting single-use plastics, mandatory recycling quotas, and producer responsibility laws.
1. **Corporate Sustainability Goals**\
   Major brands in packaging, retail, and consumer goods are committing to increased usage of post-consumer recycled (PCR) content, which is driving demand for mechanically recycled plastics.
1. **Technological Advancements**\
   Innovations in sorting, washing, and extrusion technologies have significantly improved the quality and consistency of recyclates, enabling their use in high-performance applications.
1. **Consumer Awareness**\
   Growing environmental awareness among consumers is pushing manufacturers to adopt greener materials, including recycled plastics.

**Market Segmentation**

**By Source**

- **Post-consumer waste** (e.g., bottles, containers) is the largest source of recycled plastic.
- **Pre-consumer or industrial scrap** offers cleaner, more consistent feedstock.

**By Polymer Type**

- **PE and PET** dominate due to widespread usage in packaging.
- **PP and PVC** are gaining traction despite more complex recycling processes.
- **Polystyrene and other mixed plastics** are emerging areas, often handled through advanced mechanical systems or hybrid processes.

**By End-Use Industry**

- **Packaging** remains the largest end-user, especially for food containers, e-commerce parcels, and flexible films.
- **Automotive** uses recycled plastics in non-critical components like interiors and bumpers.
- **Construction** benefits from recycled materials in piping, insulation, and fittings.
- **Textiles** use recycled PET to manufacture polyester-based fabrics.
- **Electronics and agriculture** are emerging verticals leveraging durable recycled polymers.
