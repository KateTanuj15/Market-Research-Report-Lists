**Market Overview**

The global trona market is witnessing steady growth, driven by increasing industrial applications and demand for soda ash. According to the report published by Stats and Research, the market is expected to register a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.5 percent during the forecast period from 2023 to 2030. Trona, a naturally occurring mineral, is primarily used in the production of soda ash, which plays a vital role in several industries including glass, chemicals, detergents, and environmental applications.

In 2022, soda ash production accounted for 90.6 percent of the total market revenue. Glass manufacturing remained the largest end-use sector, contributing 56.3 percent to the market revenue in the same year. With the rise in global construction and manufacturing activities, the demand for trona-based soda ash is projected to grow consistently through 2030.

**Growth Opportunities**

The trona market is supported by a combination of economic, industrial, and environmental factors. One of the primary growth drivers is the increasing global demand for glass products, especially in automotive and construction sectors. As glass production heavily relies on soda ash, the demand for trona is growing accordingly.

Another significant opportunity lies in the use of trona for flue gas desulfurization, a method employed to control air pollution. With rising environmental regulations, industries are seeking effective solutions for reducing emissions. Trona-based desulfurization offers a cost-effective and sustainable option, making it a preferred choice among manufacturers and energy producers.

Additionally, the use of trona as a buffer in animal feed is emerging as a niche yet promising application. This helps improve milk quality and feed efficiency in livestock, contributing to the agricultural sector’s adoption of trona-based additives.
