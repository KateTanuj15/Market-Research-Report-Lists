- No emissions during operation
- High efficiency in modular applications

**Flash Steam Technology**

This traditional technology remains relevant in high-enthalpy geothermal fields. It accounts for a significant portion of current global capacity.

**Challenges:**

- Requires high resource temperatures (>180°C)
- Greater environmental footprint compared to binary systems

**Dry Steam Technology**

Among the oldest and most efficient methods, dry steam is limited by resource availability. Plants like The Geysers in California still set benchmarks in performance.

**Other Emerging Technologies**

Innovations such as **enhanced geothermal systems (EGS)** and **co-production with oil and gas fields** are gaining traction. These technologies aim to tap into previously inaccessible geothermal reservoirs.

**Application Segmentation**

**Industrial Sector**

Heavy industries increasingly adopt geothermal power for both electricity and direct heat applications. The demand is rising in sectors like pulp and paper, food processing, and chemical manufacturing.

**Commercial Sector**

Hotels, greenhouses, and aquaculture farms benefit from geothermal heating, reducing operational costs and aligning with sustainability goals.

**Residential Sector**

Geothermal heat pumps (GHPs) are becoming mainstream in urban planning and housing development. Adoption is particularly strong in colder climates where heating costs are substantial.
